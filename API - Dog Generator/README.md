# API Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of how to use basic API calls and promises, and to demonstrate that I know how to parse responses when they are recieved in JSON format. 

The api that is used is the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). 

when the site loads an API call is made to get the list of breeds included in the API and then javascript DOM techniques are used to populate the dropdown menu where the user can select which breed they want their dog to be. Once the user selects the breed which they want an event listener is triggered and a picture of the breed they chose is shown on the screen. As well, interesting facts and information is generated using a JS object and it is displayed in the user doggo characteristics section.

The site can be seen live here: [Dog Generator Using API](https://dog-api-generator.netlify.app/).
